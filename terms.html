				<br>
				9. Standard Packaging: All orders must be in multiples of Seller's standard packaging and in multiples of Seller's standard palletizing. This
				is to control product damage during shipping, and any deviation from standard packaging (standard palletizing) will be accessed a $35 per
				re-pack charge. Seller and Buyer should note standard packing (standard palletizing) requirements at time of Seller's quotation.<br>
				<br>
				10. Manufacturing Deviations: Seller makes every effort to provide quality products that meet the requirements as detailed in Seller's catalogs
				and associated drawings. All manufactured products are subject to tolerances and variations, and Buyer should ascertain these limits if the
				Seller's product is used in an assembly situation involving tight and demanding tolerances.<br>
				<br>
				11. Warranty: Seller warrants products to be free of material and manufacturing defects for a period of one (1) year from date of Invoice,
				provided products as used by Buyer will not be subject to abuse, misuse, misapplication, neglect, accident, or improper installation by
				Buyer. This is a material only warranty and Seller will not reimburse Buyer, nor any associated parties, for any related costs to change-out
				product for the Buyer or Buyer's customer, nor will any loss of associated revenue be considered by Seller to be reimbursable.<br>
				<br>
				12. Returns: Product Returns will be considered by Seller for standard products only and will not honor returns for Special Products. Returned
				products must be assigned an RMA# prior to return shipment, and Buyer will pay cost of return freight. Products must be returned in
				original packaging to facilitate resale by Seller. Products will be inspected, and if found acceptable for resale, Seller will issue a Credit
				Invoice to be used for a future order placement of any of Seller's products. The Credit Invoice (C.I.) will be calculated as follows: C.I. =
				(Original Invoice Price) - (25% restocking & inspection fee) - (actual cost of original outbound freight, if paid by Seller).<br>
